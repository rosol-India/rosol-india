     <h2 class="accordion-header">Q1. How much land is required to setup a 1MW solar power generation Unit?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The land required for a 1 MW power plant setup is around 4.5-5 acres for Crystalline technology and around 6.5-7.5 acres for Thin-Film technology. This is only a rough benchmark and may vary based on technology and efficiency of panels.</p> 
     </div> 
         <h2 class="accordion-header">Q2. What is the life-time of a typical Solar Power plant?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The useful life of a typical Solar Power plant is considered to be 25 years. This is the duration for which long-term PPAs are signed and financial models are built. However, Solar Power plants can run beyond 25 years while producing a lower output. Many Solar Panel manufacturers guarantee an output of 90% at the end of 10 years and 80% at the end of 25 years.</p>

         <h2 class="accordion-header">Q3. How much land is required to setup a 1MW solar power generation Unit?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The land required for a 1 MW power plant setup is around 4.5-5 acres for Crystalline technology and around 6.5-7.5 acres for Thin-Film technology. This is only a rough benchmark and may vary based on technology and efficiency of panels.</p> 
     </div> 
         <h2 class="accordion-header">Q4. What is the annual energy generated from a 1 MW Solar Power plant?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The usual benchmark for energy generated from a 1 MW Solar Power plant is considered as 1.5 Million units. This is only a benchmark and should not be considered as the actual output for a given location. The amount of actual energy generated from a Solar Power Plant in an year depends on both internal and external factors. External factors which are beyond the control of a Solar developer can include the following:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Number of sunny days</li>
            <li>Solar Irradiation</li>
            <li>Day Temperatures</li>
            <li>Air Mass</li>
          </ul>

         <h2 class="accordion-header">Q5. How much land is required to setup a 1MW solar power generation Unit?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The land required for a 1 MW power plant setup is around 4.5-5 acres for Crystalline technology and around 6.5-7.5 acres for Thin-Film technology. This is only a rough benchmark and may vary based on technology and efficiency of panels.</p>

         <h2 class="accordion-header">Q6. What is the cost of setting up a Rooftop Solar Power plant for domestic or commercial use?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>Rooftop Solar Power plants can be broadly categorized into Battery-based and Non-Battery based systems. The benchmark cost set by MNRE for the year 2013-14 for these systems are Rs.90-100 per W for Non-Battery based systems and Rs.170-210 per W for Battery-based systems. More details can be accessed on the following MNRE webpage:<a href="http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/amendmends-benchmarkcost-aa-jnnsm-2013-14.pdf">Know More</a></p>

      <h2 class="accordion-header">Q7. What if I chose a grid-tie/on-grid system?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>If you want a grid-tie solar system then capacity of grid tie system shall not be more than your average AC load. So if your average electricity requirement is 2000watts, you would go for a grid-tie inverter of 2000watts. 2kW capacity solar array and solar grid tie inverter can be use for this application.

      <h2 class="accordion-header">Q8. Will I see a difference in my lights or in how appliances run, like on a generator?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>Solar electricity is identical to grid power, so you will never notice that the house is running on solar power. What you will see, of course, is a smaller electric bill!</p> 
     </div> 
      <h2 class="accordion-header">Q9. What do the terms on-grid, grid-connected, grid-tied and off-grid mean?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>On-grid, grid-connected or grid-tied means connected to the utility electrical grid. Our solar electric systems are designed as on-grid systems, meaning that they interconnect with your existing utility service. Off-grid refers to systems that are not connected to the utility electrical grid. Our solar electric packaged systems are not designed for off-grid applications. An off-grid system must be custom designed by a solar power expert.</p> 
     </div> 
      <h2 class="accordion-header">Q10. Will my system work on cloudy days?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>Yes, though they produce less electricity. Under a light overcast sky, panels might produce about half as much as under full sun.</p> 
     </div> 
      <h2 class="accordion-header">Q11. Do I need planning approval?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>Generally not.
              However, if your property is heritage listed you will need to attain planning approval. If you live in a complex governed by a strata agreement, you will need approval from the body corporate.
