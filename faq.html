     <h2 class="accordion-header">How much land is required to setup a 1MW solar power generation Unit?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The land required for a 1 MW power plant setup is around 4.5-5 acres for Crystalline technology and around 6.5-7.5 acres for Thin-Film technology. This is only a rough benchmark and may vary based on technology and efficiency of panels.</p>

         <h2 class="accordion-header">What is the life-time of a typical Solar Power plant?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The useful life of a typical Solar Power plant is considered to be 25 years. This is the duration for which long-term PPAs are signed and financial models are built. However, Solar Power plants can run beyond 25 years while producing a lower output. Many Solar Panel manufacturers guarantee an output of 90% at the end of 10 years and 80% at the end of 25 years.</p>

         <h2 class="accordion-header">What is the annual energy generated from a 1 MW Solar Power plant?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>The usual benchmark for energy generated from a 1 MW Solar Power plant is considered as 1.5 Million units. This is only a benchmark and should not be considered as the actual output for a given location. The amount of actual energy generated from a Solar Power Plant in an year depends on both internal and external factors. External factors which are beyond the control of a Solar developer can include the following:</p> 
          <ul>
          	<li>Number of sunny days</li>
          	<li>Solar Irradiation</li>
          	<li>Day Temperatures</li>
          	<li>Air Mass</li>
          </ul>

         <h2 class="accordion-header">What is the cost of setting up a Rooftop Solar Power plant for domestic or commercial use?</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
          <p>Rooftop Solar Power plants can be broadly categorized into Battery-based and Non-Battery based systems. The benchmark cost set by MNRE for the year 2013-14 for these systems are Rs.90-100 per W for Non-Battery based systems and Rs.170-210 per W for Battery-based systems.
