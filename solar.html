		<h2>What is Solar Energy</h2>
		<p>
			Solar Energy is basically energy that we get from the sun and is converted into energy that we can use for different purposes like generating 			electicity. Usually Solar cells and Solar panels are used to convert solar energy into electrical energy.

			<h3>Solar cells</h3>
			Solar cells are devices that convert light energy directly into electrical energy. In these cells, there are semiconductors (silicon alloys and 			other materials). Solar cells are also called photovoltaic cells or PV devices.
			<h3>Solar panels</h3>
			Solar panels absorb the sunlight as a source of energy to generate electricity or heat.
			A photovoltaic (PV) module is a packaged, connect assembly of typically 6x10 photovoltaic solar cells. Photovoltaic modules constitute the 			photovoltaic array of a photovoltaic system that generates and supplies solar electricity in commercial and residential applications. Each 			module is rated by its DC output power under standard test conditions (STC), and typically ranges from 100 to 365 Watts (W). The efficiency of 			a module determines the area of a module given the same rated output – an 8% efficient 230 W module will have twice the area of a 16% efficient 			230 W module. There are a few commercially available solar modules that exceed efficiency of 22% and reportedly also exceeding 24%. A single 			solar module can produce only a limited amount of power  most installations contain multiple modules. A photovoltaic system typically includes 			an array of photovoltaic modules, an inverter, a battery pack for storage, interconnection wiring, and optionally a solar tracking mechanism.
			The most common application of solar panels is solar water heating systems.
			They are often located on the roofs of buildings where they can receive the most sunlight.

		<h2>Why should we go for Solar</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Renewable and Sustainable:</b> Solar power is renewable and sustainable. Sun is going to shine till the end of this planet. It all 				depend on us how can we make best use of resources and use this free source of energy to power our homes and offices.
			</li><br/>
			<li> <b>Power Remote Areas:</b> we can use solar energy to generate electricity in those areas where there is very less/no electricity.
			</li><br/>
			<li> <b>Environment Friendly:</b> Solar energy doesn’t produce any kind of pollution at all. This is one of the big reason why it is favored by 				many people all around the world.
			</li><br/>
			<li> <b>Reduce Electricity Bills:</b> The electricity that is generated can be used to power fans, lights, charge mobiles and much more and is 				very helpful in reducing electricity bills. The surplus electricity that is generated can be send back to the power grid and you can 				get rebate in your monthly electricity bill.
			</li><br/>
			<li> <b>Low Maintenance:</b> Solar panels when installed, require little or no maintenance. They require cleaning only few times a year.
			</li><br/>
			<li> <b>Cost Effective:</b> A Solar power project only requires first time investment for installation and setup.It can work well upto 25 years 				on an average with a little or no maintanenace at all.Hence all the investments would be recovered by the generated electricity with 				the additional profit.
